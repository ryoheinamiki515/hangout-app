# Hangout-App
Ryohei Namiki
## Concept
I wanted to create a website that people can use to determine where to hangout with friends. The finished website will use the google places API to 1. autofill the user's search when looking for an address, 2. display markers progressively on a Google Map, and 3. display places to eat around the area. The user will be able to input multiple addresses as markers, and the website will automatically find the center point of all markers added. The website will then generate results of restaurants in the area based on how the user would like to filter their search.
